This project aims to analyze the complex interactions and contagion dynamics of the NASDAQ stock and ETF market through an immonological lens. Inspired by biological immune networks, we model financial assets as nodes interacting through dynamic information exchangfe and response mechanisms. Using the Kaggle stock and ETF dataset, we will construct correlatioins, mutual information and transfer entropy. We will focus on specific high-volatility periods (e.g., COVID-19 crash, crisis) to study how market "immunity" responds to shocks. The ultimate goal is to visualize and quantify systemic resilience, propagtaion of stress and recovery (analogously to immunce system responses of a human for example).Our project aims to tell a story about how markets fight, adapt and recover like living organisms.
